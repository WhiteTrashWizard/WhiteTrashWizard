- 👋 Hi, I’m @WhiteTrashWizard, but you can just call me Andrew. I've been sandboxing Windows and Linux for around 4 years now, except with zero coding of my own.
- I’m interested in teaching myself to code, doing some worth-while projects along the way, and maybe even create something worth bragging about, eventually.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basic fundamentals of Python, HTML, cloud, and containers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some coding projects, some application building, and at some point, build the most amazing thing anyone's ever seen.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is thru facebook messenger: https://www.facebook.com/andrew.earl.7/
